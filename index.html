					## Problem

					![The problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/47609030-6c4b6a80-da2f-11e8-9c24-866d8f26a466.jpg)

					Note: Everyone who has worked in software development is aware of the frustrations and wasted time surrounding miscommunication
					and slow relay of information about new versions and delays, to the extent that often by the time the information reaches
					all members of the team it is outdated.

					## Solution

					Note: DashboardHub solves this problem so that your team can focus on creating the best possible product with no unnecessary
					hindrances. By providing a user interface, for members of the team and managers, we provide an easy monitoring system,
					with detail and a comprehensive overview. The display shows the stage at which the team is, so development, test and
					production, and the version on which they are currently working. The performance of each version is also shown.

					Note:
					What makes DashboardHub unique and necessary compared to other providers of a similar service is that we keep up-to-date
					with frequent releases, removing the increased miscommunication surrounding it.
